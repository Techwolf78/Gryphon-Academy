                  <p>Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently
                    irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component
                    quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events
                    or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material
                    reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension,
                    along with three spatial dimensions. Time has long been an important subject of study in
                    religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields
                    without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.Nevertheless, diverse fields such as
                    business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some
                    notion of time into their respective measuring systems. Time in physics is unambiguously
                    operationally defined as "what a clock reads".See Units of Time. Time is one of the seven
                    fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units and International
                    System of Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so
                    defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An
                    operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of
                    repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a
                    free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful
                    in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational
                    definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the
                    counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a
                    single continuum called spacetime bring questions about space into questions about time,
                    questions that have their roots in the works of early students of natural philosophy.</p>

                  <p>Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative
                    position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions,
                    although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless
                    four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of
                    fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe.</p>

                <div class="cutout-card__secondary">
                  <p>In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in
                    order to perform work on, or to heat, the object. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of
                    conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or
                    destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object
                    by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. Common forms of
                    energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an
                    object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy
                    stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the
                    radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature. Mass
                    and energy are closely related. Due to mass–energy equivalence, any object that has mass
                    when stationary (called rest mass) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is
                    called rest energy, and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above
                    that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total
                    energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a
                    small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough scale.</p>

                  <p>Matter is any substance that has mass and takes up space by having volume.All everyday
                    objects that we can touch are ultimately composed of atoms, which are made up of interacting
                    subatomic particles, and in everyday as well as scientific usage, "matter" generally
                    includes atoms and anything made up of them, and any particles (or combination of particles)
                    that act as if they have both rest mass and volume. However it does not include massless
                    particles such as photons, or other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound.Matter
                    exists in various states (also known as phases). These include classical everyday phases
                    such as solid, liquid, and gas – for example water exists as ice, liquid water, and gaseous
                    steam – but other states are possible, including plasma, Bose–Einstein condensates,
                    fermionic condensates, and quark–gluon plasma.</p>
