            <h2>Adulteration: A Persistent Problem</h2>
            <p>Adulteration refers to the act of adding impurities, inferior substances, or elements of lesser quality to a product, often to deceive or reduce production costs. This deceptive practice compromises the quality, purity, or safety of the original product, and it can be found in various industries, including food, textiles, and consumer goods.</p>

This can compromise the taste, quality, and even the safety of the sweets. Consumers must be cautious when buying festive sweets, opt for reputed sweet shops, and check for quality certifications.</p>
